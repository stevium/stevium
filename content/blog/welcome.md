I'm Milo≈°, and  [mstevanovic.net](https://www.mstevanovic.net) is a web representation of my curriculum vitae, showing a summarized overview of my career as a software engineer. [stevium.com](https://stevium.com/), on the other hand, will be a more comprehensive and technical manifestation of my activity on the web, intended to serve as a home for a [blog](/blog), [projects](/pages/projects) and a [wiki](/wiki) of mine.

### Technical stack

Infrastructure of [stevium.com](/) is largely based on a "tech stack for over-engineers" indicatively named [masochist](https://github.com/wincent/masochist), and is mainly comprised of:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - Declarative, component-oriented view layer.
- [Relay](https://relay.dev/) - Declarative data-management.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - Hierarchical data querying language, type system and server.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Main content storage.
- [Redis](https://redis.io") - Indexing and caching.
- [memcached](http://memcached.org/) - Ephemeral caching.

### Supporting tools and technologies

- [Org](https://orgmode.org/) - Highly flexible structured plain text file format.
- [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) - Emacs advanced Kit focused on Evil.

### Source code and content

- All the code can be found on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stevium/stevium):
    - [main branch](https://github.com/stevium/stevium/tree/main) (the actual source)
    - [content branch](https://github.com/stevium/stevium/tree/content) (the branch for content management)
