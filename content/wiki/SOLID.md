[SOLID](/wiki/solid) is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design ([OOD](/wiki/ood.md)) principles by Ropert C. Martin AKA Uncle BOB, the author of [Clean Code](/wiki/clean_code). 

These principles help you write clean code avoiding common pitfalls such as code smells, refactoring code, spaghetti code and much more.

* S - Single Responsibility
  * Each class shoulid have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality
* O - Open Closed
  * Classes shouild be open for extension, closed for modification.
  * In other words, you should not have to write an existing class for implementing new functionality.
* L - Liskov Substitution
  * This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class
* I - Interface Segregation
  * Interface should not force classes to implement what they can't do.
* D - Dependency Inversion
  * Components should depend on abstractions not on concretions
