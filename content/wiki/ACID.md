[ACID](/wiki/acid) In order to maintain consistency in a database before and after [transaction](/wiki/transaction), certain properties are followed. These are called [ACID](/wiki/acid) properties.


* **A - Atomicity**
  > The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.
* **C - Consistency**
  > The database must be consistent before and after the transaction
* **I - Isolation**
  > Multiple Transactions occur independently without interference.
* **I - Durability**
  > The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs.
